1. **Consistency**: This factor assesses whether the artifacts are relevant to the paper and contribute inherently to the generation of its main results. Artifacts should align with the claims and content of the paper.
2. **Completeness**: This factor evaluates whether the submitted artifacts include all key components described in the paper. Artifacts should be comprehensive and cover all necessary aspects to support the paper's claims.
3. **Documentation**: This factor considers whether the artifacts are sufficiently documented to enable them to be exercised by readers of the paper. Clear instructions and documentation are crucial for understanding and using the artifacts.
4. **Reusability**: This factor examines whether the artifacts facilitate reuse and repurposing by others. Artifacts should be designed to be easily adaptable for further research and experimentation.
5. **Exercisability**: This factor checks if the submitted artifacts include the scripts and data needed to run the experiments described in the paper, and whether the software can be successfully executed. Artifacts should be functional and operable.
6. **Availability**: This factor determines if the artifacts have been made available for retrieval, permanently and publicly, through suitable digital repositories. Public availability is essential for the "Artifacts Available" badge.
7. **Reproducibility**: This factor assesses whether the artifacts can be used to independently obtain the main results presented in the paper. The goal is to validate the paper's claims through independent reproduction of results.
8. **Packaging**: This factor involves how the artifacts are packaged, including the inclusion of a README file with instructions, and the use of formats like source code, containers, or virtual machines to facilitate installation and use.
9. **Badging System**: This factor relates to the criteria for awarding badges, such as "Artifacts Available," "Artifacts Evaluated—Functional," "Artifacts Evaluated—Reusable," and "Results Reproduced." Each badge has specific requirements that the artifacts must meet.
10. **User Interface**: This factor considers the usability of the artifact's interface, ensuring that it is intuitive and accessible for users to interact with the artifact effectively.
