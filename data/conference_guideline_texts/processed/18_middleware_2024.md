1. Valid URL: The submission must include a valid URL pointing to the artifacts, such as source code and datasets, which are necessary for reproducing the work. This ensures that the materials are accessible and can be reviewed by the committee.
2. Repository Platform: It is strongly recommended to use GitHub for hosting the artifacts, although other repository URLs are accepted. This provides a standardized and reliable platform for accessing and managing the artifacts.
3. README.md File: The artifacts must include a README.md file in Markdown format that documents the details of the artifacts. This file serves as a guide for understanding and using the materials, ensuring clarity and ease of use.
4. Artifacts Available Badge: To qualify for this badge, the submission must meet the basic requirements of providing a valid URL and a README.md file. This badge indicates that the artifacts are accessible and documented.
5. Artifacts Evaluated - Functional Badge: To qualify for this badge, the submission must request manual evaluation and provide reproducible steps in the README.md. The committee will follow these steps to verify functionality, ensuring that the artifacts work as intended in a reasonable computing environment.
6. Reproducibility: The steps provided in the README.md must be reproducible in a standard computing environment, such as a cloud VM or a Mac, without requiring additional hardware. This ensures that the artifacts can be independently verified by the committee.
7. Clarification Opportunity: Authors have a limited window to provide clarifications if issues arise during the evaluation. This allows for resolving misunderstandings and ensuring the artifacts meet the evaluation criteria.
8. Virtual Demo Meeting: If additional hardware is necessary for evaluation, authors must inform the committee in advance to arrange a virtual demo meeting. This ensures that the evaluation process can accommodate specific hardware requirements.
