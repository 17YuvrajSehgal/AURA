1. **Reproducibility**: The ability of the artifact to allow others to reproduce the experimental results presented in the paper. This involves clear documentation and the provision of all necessary components to replicate the study.
2. **Documentation**: The extent to which the artifact is well-documented, including detailed instructions on how to set up, run, and validate the experiments. This includes the use of the Artifact Appendix template to describe software, hardware, and data dependencies.
3. **Completeness**: The artifact should be complete, meaning it includes all necessary components such as code, data sets, models, and any other materials required to reproduce the results.
4. **Consistency**: The artifact should be consistent with the claims and results presented in the paper. This means that the outputs generated by the artifact should match the results reported in the publication.
5. **Exercisability**: The artifact should be exercisable, meaning it can be executed and tested by the evaluators. This involves providing scripts or instructions to run the experiments and verify the results.
6. **Verification and Validation**: The artifact should include evidence of verification and validation, demonstrating that the results are accurate and reliable.
7. **Public Availability**: The artifact should be publicly available in an archival repository, such as Zenodo or FigShare, with a DOI provided. This ensures that the artifact can be accessed and used by the broader community.
8. **Hardware and Software Requirements**: The artifact should clearly specify any hardware and software dependencies, including any proprietary components, to ensure evaluators have the necessary resources to run the experiments.
9. **Workflow Automation**: The use of workflow automation frameworks or scripts to streamline the process of setting up and running experiments, which aids in reproducibility and ease of use.
10. **Artifact Badging**: The assignment of ACM badges to artifacts that meet certain criteria, such as being available, functional, and validated. These badges serve as a recognition of the artifact's quality and reproducibility.
11. **Experiment Customization**: The ability to customize experiments, allowing evaluators to modify parameters or settings to explore different scenarios or validate results under varying conditions.
