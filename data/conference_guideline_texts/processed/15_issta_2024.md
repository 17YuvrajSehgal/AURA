1. **Availability**: This factor assesses whether the artifact is accessible to everyone interested in inspecting or using it. Artifacts must be uploaded to a platform like Zenodo to obtain a DOI, ensuring they are publicly available and citable.
2. **Functionality**: This factor evaluates whether the artifact supports the main claims of the paper. Reviewers check if the artifact can be set up and its general functionality verified within 30 minutes, as guided by the README file.
3. **Reusability**: This factor considers whether other researchers can inspect, understand, and extend the artifact. It requires comprehensive documentation, automation, and inclusion of all necessary components for extension, such as source code and setup instructions.
4. **Getting Started**: This section of the README file is crucial for guiding reviewers through the initial setup and verification of the artifact's basic functionality. It should include requirements, setup instructions, and expected outcomes.
5. **Detailed Description**: This section of the README file should provide step-by-step instructions to replicate experiments or analyses, explaining how the artifact's outputs validate the paper's claims.
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is essential for both functionality and reusability. It should describe plausible scenarios for extending the artifact and may include additional resources like video tutorials.
7. **Badging System**: The evaluation process awards badges for different objectives: "Artifact Available," "Artifact Evaluated - Functional," and "Artifact Evaluated - Reusable." Each badge represents a successful evaluation of the corresponding factor.
8. **Distinguished Artifact Awards**: Artifacts that exceed the committee's expectations may receive a Distinguished Artifact Award, recognizing exceptional quality and contribution.
