1. **Reproducibility**: Ensures that the artifact can be used to replicate the results claimed in the paper, demonstrating the reliability and accuracy of the research.
2. **Functionality**: Verifies that the artifact works as intended and performs the tasks described in the paper, confirming the artifact's operational integrity.
3. **Documentation**: Assesses the clarity and completeness of the instructions provided for installing and running the artifact, which is crucial for usability and understanding.
4. **Completeness**: Evaluates whether all necessary components (e.g., code, data, scripts) are included and accessible, ensuring that the artifact is self-contained and ready for evaluation.
5. **Automation**: Looks for the presence of workflow scripts that allow for automatic execution of experiments, reducing the need for manual intervention and enhancing reproducibility.
6. **Hardware and Software Requirements**: Checks the detailed list of hardware and software needed to run the artifact, ensuring that evaluators can prepare the necessary environment.
7. **Remote Access**: For hardware-dependent artifacts, evaluates the provision of remote access to the hardware setup, allowing evaluators to assess the artifact without physical presence.
8. **Public Accessibility**: Requires that the source code and related materials are available in publicly accessible repositories, facilitating transparency and community access.
9. **Time and Resource Estimation**: Considers the estimated time and resources needed to run the artifact, helping evaluators plan and manage their evaluation process.
10. **Badging System**: Involves applying for specific ACM badges ("Artifact available", "Artifact evaluated - functional", "Results reproduced") that recognize the quality and reproducibility of the artifact.
11. **Demo Video**: For complex or environment-specific experiments, evaluates the use of demo videos to demonstrate key functionalities, aiding in the assessment of reproducibility.
12. **Environmental Settings**: Ensures that any specific environmental conditions required for experiments are clearly described and replicated, maintaining consistency with the paper's claims.
13. **Reduced Experiment Scope**: For time-consuming experiments, assesses the feasibility of a reduced but representative scope of experiments, balancing thoroughness with practicality.
