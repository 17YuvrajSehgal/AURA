1. **Artifacts Available**: This factor assesses whether all artifacts related to the paper are publicly accessible. Artifacts must be placed in a publicly accessible archival repository to receive the "Artifacts Available" badge.
2. **Artifacts Evaluated - Functional**: This factor evaluates whether the artifacts are complete, well-documented, consistent, and exercisable. It checks if the artifacts include scripts or software to perform experiments and generate results, and if they provide evidence of verification and validation.
3. **Results Reproduced**: This factor determines if the key results of the paper can be validated using the provided artifacts by someone other than the authors. It considers the reproducibility of empirical and numerical results, allowing for some variation.
4. **Documentation**: This factor examines the quality and completeness of the documentation provided with the artifacts. It ensures that the documentation is sufficient to understand, install, and evaluate the artifact.
5. **System Requirements and Dependencies**: This factor reviews the clarity and completeness of the information regarding the software and hardware requirements necessary to run the artifacts.
6. **Experiment Workflow**: This factor evaluates the clarity and detail of the steps provided for conducting experiments and reproducing results using the artifacts.
7. **Proprietary Components**: This factor considers how proprietary components are handled, ensuring that necessary proxies or instructions are provided if proprietary data or software is required.
8. **Public Archival Repository**: This factor checks if the artifacts are stored in a repository with a declared plan for permanent accessibility, which is necessary for the "Artifacts Available" badge.
9. **Iterative Improvement**: This factor reflects the process of interaction between authors and reviewers to address issues and improve the artifacts during the evaluation process.
10. **Distinguished Artifact Award**: This factor considers whether an artifact is functional, well-documented, portable, easily reproducible, and reusable by the community, qualifying it for a distinguished artifact award.
