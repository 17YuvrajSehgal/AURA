1. **Artifacts Available**: This factor assesses whether all artifacts related to the paper are publicly accessible in a permanent archival repository, which is necessary for receiving the "artifact available" badge.
2. **Artifacts Functional**: This factor evaluates if the artifacts are complete, well-documented, consistent, and exercisable, including scripts and software necessary for performing experiments and generating results. It is crucial for obtaining the "Artifacts Evaluated - Functional" badge.
3. **Results Reproduced**: This factor checks if the key results of the paper can be validated by an independent team using the provided artifacts. Successful validation is required for the "Results Reproduced" badge.
4. **Documentation**: This factor ensures that the artifacts are accompanied by sufficient documentation to understand, install, and evaluate them, which is essential for the functional evaluation of the artifacts.
5. **Consistency**: This factor examines whether the artifacts are relevant to the associated paper and contribute inherently to the generation of its main results, ensuring alignment between the paper and the artifacts.
6. **Exercisability**: This factor determines if the artifacts include necessary scripts and software to perform appropriate experiments, which is vital for verifying the functionality of the artifacts.
7. **Verification and Validation**: This factor involves providing evidence that the artifacts have been verified and validated, which is necessary for the functional evaluation badge.
8. **Public Accessibility**: This factor requires that artifacts be placed in a publicly accessible archival repository with a DOI, ensuring long-term accessibility and eligibility for the "artifact available" badge.
9. **Reproducibility**: This factor emphasizes the ability to reproduce key results from the paper using the provided artifacts, which is critical for the "Results Reproduced" badge.
10. **Proprietary Artifacts**: This factor notes that proprietary artifacts need not be included, but instructions on obtaining them should be documented if required, ensuring transparency and accessibility.
11. **Sample Data**: This factor suggests providing a small/sample data set to validate some results from the paper, aiding in the functional evaluation of the artifacts.
