2. **Functionality**: This evaluates whether the artifact works as described. It involves verifying that the software, scripts, and data perform the intended tasks and produce the expected results.
3. **Reproducibility**: This factor examines the ability to reproduce the results presented in the paper using the provided artifacts. It includes checking the completeness and accuracy of the documentation and scripts needed to replicate experiments.
4. **Documentation**: This assesses the clarity and comprehensiveness of the documentation provided with the artifact. It should include detailed instructions for system setup, experiment execution, and result verification.
5. **Environment Specification**: This evaluates how well the authors specify the required environment, including OS, tools, hardware dependencies, and any specific configurations needed to run the artifact.
6. **System Setup**: This factor looks at the ease and automation of setting up the system. It includes the availability of scripts to automate installation, configuration, and deployment processes.
7. **Experiment Automation**: This assesses whether the experiments can be run automatically using scripts, rather than requiring manual intervention. It includes the ability to handle different parameter values and produce consistent results.
8. **Graph and Plot Generation**: This evaluates the provision of scripts or tools to generate graphs and plots from experimental data. It checks if the process is well-documented and reproducible.
9. **Master Script**: This factor considers the presence of a master script that automates the entire process from installation to result generation, including recompiling the paper with updated results.
10. **Badging Criteria**: This evaluates the artifact against specific criteria for awarding badges, such as availability, functionality, and reproducibility, to recognize the quality and completeness of the artifact.
