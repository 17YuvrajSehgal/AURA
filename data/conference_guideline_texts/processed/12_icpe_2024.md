1. **Artifacts Available**: This factor assesses whether the author-created artifacts have been placed on a publicly accessible archival repository. A DOI or link to this repository, along with a unique identifier of the object, must be provided to ensure permanent availability.
2. **Documented**: This factor evaluates whether the artifact is accompanied by relevant documentation that makes it easy to use. Proper documentation is crucial for understanding and utilizing the artifact effectively.
3. **Consistent**: This factor checks if the artifact is relevant to the associated paper and contributes in some inherent way to the generation of its main research results or motivating success stories. Consistency ensures that the artifact aligns with the claims and findings of the research.
4. **Complete**: This factor assesses whether all components relevant to the research or artifact paper are included. Completeness ensures that the artifact package is self-sufficient, with proxies for proprietary data included if necessary.
5. **Exercisable**: This factor evaluates whether the artifact is easy to download, install, or execute. It checks if included scripts and/or software can be successfully executed and if included data can be accessed and appropriately manipulated.
6. **Artifacts Evaluated - Functional**: This badge is awarded when the artifacts are found to be documented, consistent, complete, exercisable, and include appropriate evidence of verification and validation.
7. **Artifacts Evaluated - Results Reproduced**: This badge applies only to artifacts submitted alongside Research or Industry papers. It is awarded when the main results of the paper have been obtained in a subsequent study by a person or team other than the authors, using, in part, artifacts provided by the author.
8. **Artifacts Evaluated - Reusable**: This badge is awarded when the artifacts are of a quality that significantly exceeds minimal functionality. They must be very carefully documented and well-structured to facilitate reuse and repurposing, adhering to norms and standards of the research community.
