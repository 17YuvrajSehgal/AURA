1. **Functionality**: Evaluates whether the artifact is functional, meaning it is documented, consistent, complete, exercisable, and includes appropriate evidence of verification and validation.
2. **Documentation**: Assesses if the artifact includes an inventory and sufficient description to enable the artifacts to be exercised.
3. **Consistency**: Checks if the artifacts are relevant to the associated paper and contribute in some inherent way to the generation of its main results.
4. **Completeness**: Ensures that all components relevant to the paper are included, except for proprietary artifacts, which should be documented with instructions on how to obtain them.
5. **Exercisability**: Determines if the included scripts and/or software can be successfully executed and if the included data can be accessed and appropriately manipulated.
6. **Customizability and Reusability**: Evaluates if the artifact and experimental workflow can be easily reused and customized, such as being used on different platforms or with different benchmarks.
7. **Results Validation**: Assesses whether the main results from the paper can be validated using the provided artifacts, with a tolerance for variation in empirical and numerical results.
8. **Artifacts Available Badge**: Indicates that an artifact is publicly accessible in an archival repository, without requiring independent evaluation.
9. **Artifacts Evaluated - Functional Badge**: Awarded when artifacts are found to be documented, consistent, complete, exercisable, and include appropriate evidence of verification and validation.
10. **Artifacts Evaluated - Reusable Badge**: Given to artifacts that exceed minimal functionality, are carefully documented, and well-structured to facilitate reuse and repurposing.
11. **Results Validated & Reproduced Badge**: Applied to papers where the main results have been successfully obtained by a person or team other than the author, with results in agreement within an acceptable tolerance.
12. **Packaging Guidelines**: Encourages the use of container or VM technologies like Docker or Virtual Box to package the artifact in a stand-alone container or VM with all required dependencies.
13. **Artifact Appendix**: Requires an appendix in the paper providing a link to and a description of the artifact, with a page limit of up to two pages, placed before the References section.
14. **Single-Blind Evaluation**: The artifact evaluation process is single-blind, meaning authors' names are known to the evaluators, but evaluators' names are not known to the authors.
