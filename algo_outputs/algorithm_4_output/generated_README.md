## Data Collection And Processing
## Data Collection and Processing

This section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.

### Data Collection

The data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:

```
data
│
├── testing
│   ├── Cat
│   │   ├── 1000.jpg
│   │   └── 10005.jpg
│   └── Dog
│       ├── 1000.jpg
│       └── 10005.jpg
│
└── training
    ├── Cat
    │   ├── 0.jpg
    │   └── 1.jpg
    └── Dog
        ├── 0.jpg
        └── 1.jpg
```

The `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.

### Data Processing

Prior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:

- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.
- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.
- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.
- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.
- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.

### Data Privacy and Ethics

The images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.

### Data License

The data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.

### Version 1.0.0 (Initial Release) - 2025-01-01

The initial release of the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact includes the following features:

- A machine learning model designed for binary image classification, specifically distinguishing between images of cats and dogs.
- Python scripts that define the model (`model.py`), train it (`train.py`), and evaluate its performance (`evaluate.py`).
- A dataset comprising images of cats and dogs, intended for model training and testing.
- Unit tests to verify the model's functionality (`test_model.py`).
