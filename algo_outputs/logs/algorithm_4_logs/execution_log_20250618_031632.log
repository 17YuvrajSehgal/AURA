Feedback: The introduction is clear, comprehensive, and useful for a research artifact. It provides a good overview of the repository, its structure, usage, and contribution guidelines. However, it could be improved by providing more information about the machine learning model used, such as the type of model, its architecture, and performance metrics. This would give users a better understanding of the model's capabilities and limitations.

## Artifact Description

This artifact, 'ml-image-classifier', is a machine learning model designed to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained and evaluated using a dataset of images stored within the repository. The artifact is written in Python and includes scripts for training the model, evaluating its performance, and testing its functionality.

### Directory Structure

The artifact is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- `data`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the model. The dataset is divided into 'training' and 'testing' subdirectories, each containing 'Cat' and 'Dog' subdirectories. These subdirectories house the respective images of cats and dogs.

- `src`: This directory houses the Python scripts that define the model (`model.py`), train the model (`train.py`), and evaluate the model's performance (`evaluate.py`).

- `tests`: This directory contains a Python script (`test_model.py`) that tests the functionality of the model.

### Code

The Python scripts in the `src` directory are the core of the artifact. The `model.py` script defines the machine learning model used for image classification. The `train.py` script trains the model using the images in the 'training' subdirectory of the 'data' directory. The `evaluate.py` script evaluates the model's performance using the images in the 'testing' subdirectory of the 'data' directory.

### Data

The images used for training and testing the model are stored in the 'training' and 'testing' subdirectories of the 'data' directory, respectively. Each subdirectory contains 'Cat' and 'Dog' subdirectories, which house the respective images of cats and dogs.

      "section": "data collection and processing",
      "content": "## Data Collection and Processing\n\nThis section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

      "section": "data collection and processing",
      "content": "## Data Collection and Processing\n\nThis section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

      "content": "## Code Structure\n\nThe 'ml-image-classifier' codebase is structured into three main directories: `data`, `src`, and `tests`. \n\n### `data` Directory\n\nThe `data` directory houses the dataset utilized for training and testing the machine learning model. It is subdivided into two sections:\n\n- `training`: This section contains images of cats and dogs used to train the model. Each image category is stored in its respective subdirectory, namely `Cat` and `Dog`.\n- `testing`: This section holds images of cats and dogs used for model testing. Like the `training` directory, each image category is stored in its respective subdirectory.\n\n### `src` Directory\n\nThe `src` directory comprises Python scripts that define, train, and evaluate the model. It includes:\n\n- `__init__.py`: An empty file that signals Python to treat the directory as a package.\n- `model.py`: This file defines the machine learning model for image classification.\n- `train.py`: This script trains the model using images from the `training` directory.\n- `evaluate.py`: This script assesses the model's performance using images from the `testing` directory.\n\n### `tests` Directory\n\nThe `tests` directory contains a Python script, `test_model.py`, that conducts unit tests on the model. Like the `src` directory, it also includes an `__init__.py` file.\n\n### Root Directory\n\nThe repository's root directory contains:\n\n- `.gitignore`: This file specifies which files and directories Git should ignore.\n- `LICENSE`: This file details the terms under which the artifact is licensed.\n- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the artifact and instructions for its installation and use.\n\n### Code Execution Flow\n\nThe artifact's code execution follows this sequence:\n\n1.

      "section": "data collection and processing",
      "content": "## Data Collection and Processing\n\nThis section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

Like the `training` directory, each image category is stored in its respective subdirectory.\n\n### `src` Directory\n\nThe `src` directory comprises Python scripts that define, train, and evaluate the model. It includes:\n\n- `__init__.py`: An empty file that signals Python to treat the directory as a package.\n- `model.py`: This file defines the machine learning model for image classification.\n- `train.py`: This script trains the model using images from the `training` directory.\n- `evaluate.py`: This script assesses the model's performance using images from the `testing` directory.\n\n### `tests` Directory\n\nThe `tests` directory contains a Python script, `test_model.py`, that conducts unit tests on the model. Like the `src` directory, it also includes an `__init__.py` file.\n\n### Root Directory\n\nThe repository's root directory contains:\n\n- `.gitignore`: This file specifies which files and directories Git should ignore.\n- `LICENSE`: This file details the terms under which the artifact is licensed.\n- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the artifact and instructions for its installation and use.\n\n### Code Execution Flow\n\nThe artifact's code execution follows this sequence:\n\n1. The model is defined in `model.py`.\n2. The model is trained using images from the `training` directory via `train.py`.\n3. The model's performance is evaluated using images from the `testing` directory via `evaluate.py`.\n4. The model's functionality is tested via `test_model.py`.\n\n### Code Dependencies\n\nThe codebase has several dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file in the root directory. These dependencies must be installed for the artifact to function properly.\n\n### Code License\n\nThe code is licensed under the MIT License, as detailed in the `LICENSE` file in the root directory.\n\n### Code Citation\n\nIf this code contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

      "section": "data collection and processing",
      "content": "## Data Collection and Processing\n\nThis section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

      "section": "data collection and processing",
      "content": "## Data Collection and Processing\n\nThis section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

      "section": "data collection and processing",
      "content": "## Data Collection and Processing\n\nThis section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

It is subdivided into two sections:\n\n- `training`: This section contains images of cats and dogs used to train the model. Each image category is stored in its respective subdirectory, namely `Cat` and `Dog`.\n- `testing`: This section holds images of cats and dogs used for model testing. Like the `training` directory, each image category is stored in its respective subdirectory.\n\n### `src` Directory\n\nThe `src` directory comprises Python scripts that define, train, and evaluate the model. It includes:\n\n- `__init__.py`: An empty file that signals Python to treat the directory as a package.\n- `model.py`: This file defines the machine learning model for image classification.\n- `train.py`: This script trains the model using images from the `training` directory.\n- `evaluate.py`: This script assesses the model's performance using images from the `testing` directory.\n\n### `tests` Directory\n\nThe `tests` directory contains a Python script, `test_model.py`, that conducts unit tests on the model. Like the `src` directory, it also includes an `__init__.py` file.\n\n### Root Directory\n\nThe repository's root directory contains:\n\n- `.gitignore`: This file specifies which files and directories Git should ignore.\n- `LICENSE`: This file details the terms under which the artifact is licensed.\n- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the artifact and instructions for its installation and use.\n\n### Code Execution Flow\n\nThe artifact's code execution follows this sequence:\n\n1. The model is defined in `model.py`.\n2. The model is trained using images from the `training` directory via `train.py`.\n3. The model's performance is evaluated using images from the `testing` directory via `evaluate.py`.\n4. The model's functionality is tested via `test_model.py`.\n\n### Code Dependencies\n\nThe codebase has several dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file in the root directory. These dependencies must be installed for the artifact to function properly.\n\n### Code License\n\nThe code is licensed under the MIT License, as detailed in the `LICENSE` file in the root directory.\n\n### Code Citation\n\nIf this code contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

      "section": "data collection and processing",
      "content": "## Data Collection and Processing\n\nThis section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

      "section": "data collection and processing",
      "content": "## Data Collection and Processing\n\nThis section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

      "content": "## Code Structure\n\nThe 'ml-image-classifier' codebase is structured into three main directories: `data`, `src`, and `tests`. \n\n### `data` Directory\n\nThe `data` directory houses the dataset utilized for training and testing the machine learning model. It is subdivided into two sections:\n\n- `training`: This section contains images of cats and dogs used to train the model. Each image category is stored in its respective subdirectory, namely `Cat` and `Dog`.\n- `testing`: This section holds images of cats and dogs used for model testing. Like the `training` directory, each image category is stored in its respective subdirectory.\n\n### `src` Directory\n\nThe `src` directory comprises Python scripts that define, train, and evaluate the model. It includes:\n\n- `__init__.py`: An empty file that signals Python to treat the directory as a package.\n- `model.py`: This file defines the machine learning model for image classification.\n- `train.py`: This script trains the model using images from the `training` directory.\n- `evaluate.py`: This script assesses the model's performance using images from the `testing` directory.\n\n### `tests` Directory\n\nThe `tests` directory contains a Python script, `test_model.py`, that conducts unit tests on the model. Like the `src` directory, it also includes an `__init__.py` file.\n\n### Root Directory\n\nThe repository's root directory contains:\n\n- `.gitignore`: This file specifies which files and directories Git should ignore.\n- `LICENSE`: This file details the terms under which the artifact is licensed.\n- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the artifact and instructions for its installation and use.\n\n### Code Execution Flow\n\nThe artifact's code execution follows this sequence:\n\n1. The model is defined in `model.py`.\n2. The model is trained using images from the `training` directory via `train.py`.\n3. The model's performance is evaluated using images from the `testing` directory via `evaluate.py`.\n4. The model's functionality is tested via `test_model.py`.\n\n### Code Dependencies\n\nThe codebase has several dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file in the root directory. These dependencies must be installed for the artifact to function properly.\n\n### Code License\n\nThe code is licensed under the MIT License, as detailed in the `LICENSE` file in the root directory.\n\n### Code Citation\n\nIf this code contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

      "section": "data collection and processing",
      "content": "## Data Collection and Processing\n\nThis section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

      "content": "## Data Collection and Processing\n\nThis section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

It is subdivided into two sections:\n\n- `training`: This section contains images of cats and dogs used to train the model. Each image category is stored in its respective subdirectory, namely `Cat` and `Dog`.\n- `testing`: This section holds images of cats and dogs used for model testing. Like the `training` directory, each image category is stored in its respective subdirectory.\n\n### `src` Directory\n\nThe `src` directory comprises Python scripts that define, train, and evaluate the model. It includes:\n\n- `__init__.py`: An empty file that signals Python to treat the directory as a package.\n- `model.py`: This file defines the machine learning model for image classification.\n- `train.py`: This script trains the model using images from the `training` directory.\n- `evaluate.py`: This script assesses the model's performance using images from the `testing` directory.\n\n### `tests` Directory\n\nThe `tests` directory contains a Python script, `test_model.py`, that conducts unit tests on the model. Like the `src` directory, it also includes an `__init__.py` file.\n\n### Root Directory\n\nThe repository's root directory contains:\n\n- `.gitignore`: This file specifies which files and directories Git should ignore.\n- `LICENSE`: This file details the terms under which the artifact is licensed.\n- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the artifact and instructions for its installation and use.\n\n### Code Execution Flow\n\nThe artifact's code execution follows this sequence:\n\n1. The model is defined in `model.py`.\n2. The model is trained using images from the `training` directory via `train.py`.\n3. The model's performance is evaluated using images from the `testing` directory via `evaluate.py`.\n4. The model's functionality is tested via `test_model.py`.\n\n### Code Dependencies\n\nThe codebase has several dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file in the root directory. These dependencies must be installed for the artifact to function properly.\n\n### Code License\n\nThe code is licensed under the MIT License, as detailed in the `LICENSE` file in the root directory.\n\n### Code Citation\n\nIf this code contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

      "section": "data collection and processing",
      "content": "## Data Collection and Processing\n\nThis section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

      "content": "## Data Collection and Processing\n\nThis section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

      "content": "## Data Collection and Processing\n\nThis section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

      "section": "data collection and processing",
      "content": "## Data Collection and Processing\n\nThis section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

      "section": "data collection and processing",
      "content": "## Data Collection and Processing\n\nThis section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

      "content": "## Code Structure\n\nThe 'ml-image-classifier' codebase is structured into three main directories: `data`, `src`, and `tests`. \n\n### `data` Directory\n\nThe `data` directory houses the dataset utilized for training and testing the machine learning model. It is subdivided into two sections:\n\n- `training`: This section contains images of cats and dogs used to train the model. Each image category is stored in its respective subdirectory, namely `Cat` and `Dog`.\n- `testing`: This section holds images of cats and dogs used for model testing. Like the `training` directory, each image category is stored in its respective subdirectory.\n\n### `src` Directory\n\nThe `src` directory comprises Python scripts that define, train, and evaluate the model. It includes:\n\n- `__init__.py`: An empty file that signals Python to treat the directory as a package.\n- `model.py`: This file defines the machine learning model for image classification.\n- `train.py`: This script trains the model using images from the `training` directory.\n- `evaluate.py`: This script assesses the model's performance using images from the `testing` directory.\n\n### `tests` Directory\n\nThe `tests` directory contains a Python script, `test_model.py`, that conducts unit tests on the model. Like the `src` directory, it also includes an `__init__.py` file.\n\n### Root Directory\n\nThe repository's root directory contains:\n\n- `.gitignore`: This file specifies which files and directories Git should ignore.\n- `LICENSE`: This file details the terms under which the artifact is licensed.\n- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the artifact and instructions for its installation and use.\n\n### Code Execution Flow\n\nThe artifact's code execution follows this sequence:\n\n1.

      "content": "## Data Collection and Processing\n\nThis section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

      "section": "data collection and processing",
      "content": "## Data Collection and Processing\n\nThis section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

      "content": "## Data Collection and Processing\n\nThis section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"
