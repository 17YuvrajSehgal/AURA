      "section": "data collection and processing",
      "content": "## Data Collection and Processing\n\nThis section elucidates the procedures employed for data collection and processing in the 'ml-image-classifier' artifact.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nThe data, comprising images of cats and dogs, is sourced from various open-source platforms for the purpose of training and testing the machine learning model. These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```"

      "content": "## Code Structure\n\nThe 'ml-image-classifier' codebase is structured into three main directories: `data`, `src`, and `tests`. \n\n### `data` Directory\n\nThe `data` directory houses the dataset utilized for training and testing the machine learning model. It is subdivided into two sections:\n\n- `training`: This section contains images of cats and dogs used to train the model. Each image category is stored in its respective subdirectory, namely `Cat` and `Dog`.\n- `testing`: This section holds images of cats and dogs used for model testing. Like the `training` directory, each image category is stored in its respective subdirectory.\n\n### `src` Directory\n\nThe `src` directory comprises Python scripts that define, train, and evaluate the model. It includes:\n\n- `__init__.py`: An empty file that signals Python to treat the directory as a package.\n- `model.py`: This file defines the machine learning model for image classification.\n- `train.py`: This script trains the model using images from the `training` directory.\n- `evaluate.py`: This script assesses the model's performance using images from the `testing` directory.\n\n### `tests` Directory\n\nThe `tests` directory contains a Python script, `test_model.py`, that conducts unit tests on the model. Like the `src` directory, it also includes an `__init__.py` file.\n\n### Root Directory\n\nThe repository's root directory contains:\n\n- `.gitignore`: This file specifies which files and directories Git should ignore.\n- `LICENSE`: This file details the terms under which the artifact is licensed.\n- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the artifact and instructions for its installation and use.\n\n### Code Execution Flow\n\nThe artifact's code execution follows this sequence:\n\n1.

These images are stored in the `data` directory of the repository, which is structured as follows:\n\n```\ndata\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 testing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 1000.jpg\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 10005.jpg\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 training\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cat\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dog\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 0.jpg\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 1.jpg\n```\n\nThe `training` directory houses images for model training, while the `testing` directory contains images for model performance evaluation. Each of these directories further includes `Cat` and `Dog` subdirectories, which store the respective images.\n\n### Data Processing\n\nPrior to their use in model training and testing, the images undergo a series of processing steps, implemented in the `train.py` and `evaluate.py` scripts in the `src` directory:\n\n- **Image Resizing:** Images are resized to a standard size (e.g., 64x64 pixels) to maintain uniformity in input data dimensions.\n- **Normalization:** Pixel values, originally ranging from 0 to 255, are normalized to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating faster and more stable training.\n- **Label Encoding:** Labels ('Cat' and 'Dog') are encoded into binary format (0 and 1) to support the binary classification task.\n- **Data Augmentation (Training Data Only):** Techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training images to enhance data diversity and prevent overfitting.\n- **Train-Test Split (Training Data Only):** The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set, typically in an 80:20 ratio. The validation set aids in monitoring and adjusting the model's performance during training.\n\n### Data Privacy and Ethics\n\nThe images utilized in this project are sourced from open-source platforms and are devoid of any private or sensitive information, making them suitable for research purposes.\n\n### Data License\n\nThe data is governed by the terms of the MIT License, as outlined in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file in the repository.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf this data contributes to your research, please cite the repository as follows:\n\n```\n@misc{Patel2025,\n  author = {Patel, Sneh},\n  title = {ml-image-classifier},\n  year = {2025},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/SnehPatel/ml-image-classifier}},\n}\n```\n\n## Code Structure\n## Code Structure\n\nThe 'ml-image-classifier' codebase is structured into three main directories: `data`, `src`, and `tests`. \n\n### `data` Directory\n\nThe `data` directory houses the dataset utilized for training and testing the machine learning model.
