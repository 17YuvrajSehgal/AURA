# Enhanced Algorithm 1: Cross-Conference Artifact Evaluation Criteria Extraction and Normalization

## Overview

Enhanced Algorithm 1 is a sophisticated NLP-powered system designed to automatically extract, analyze, and normalize artifact evaluation criteria across multiple academic conferences. This algorithm addresses Research Question 1 (RQ1) in the AURA framework: *"Can we automatically extract and normalize artifact evaluation criteria across conferences?"*

The algorithm processes conference guidelines individually, performs cross-conference normalization, and generates comprehensive analytical outputs that demonstrate the feasibility of automated standardization of research artifact evaluation processes.

## Key Features

- **Conference-Specific Processing**: Analyzes each conference's guidelines separately to preserve venue-specific characteristics
- **Cross-Conference Normalization**: Creates standardized comparison metrics across different academic venues
- **Dimensional Analysis**: Identifies and quantifies evaluation dimensions (functionality, usability, reproducibility, etc.)
- **Statistical Significance Testing**: Performs rigorous statistical analysis to identify meaningful variations
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Generates six different types of analytical outputs for various use cases
- **AURA Framework Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the broader AURA research artifact evaluation system

## Technical Methodology

### Why This Approach? The Research Problem
Research artifact evaluation lacks standardization across academic conferences. Each venue has its own guidelines, terminology, and priorities, making it difficult to:
- Compare evaluation practices across conferences
- Develop universal quality standards
- Understand what makes artifacts acceptable to different venues
- Create automated evaluation systems that work across domains

Enhanced Algorithm 1 solves this by automatically extracting implicit evaluation criteria from conference guidelines and creating normalized comparisons.

### 1. Text Preprocessing and Cleaning
**Purpose**: Conference guidelines are often written in natural language with inconsistent formatting, requiring sophisticated cleaning to extract meaningful evaluation criteria.

**How it Works**:
- **Document Parsing**: Uses UTF-8 encoding to handle international conference guidelines with special characters
- **Tokenization**: Employs NLTK's word_tokenize to break text into meaningful units while preserving context
- **Lemmatization**: Reduces words to their root forms (e.g., "testing" → "test") to unify related concepts
- **Stopword Removal**: Eliminates common words ("the", "and", "is") that don't carry evaluation meaning
- **Noise Filtering**: Removes punctuation, short tokens (<3 chars), and numeric strings that aren't evaluation criteria

**Why This Matters**: Raw conference guidelines contain formatting artifacts, administrative text, and inconsistent terminology. This preprocessing ensures the algorithm focuses on actual evaluation requirements rather than document structure.

### 2. Hierarchical Feature Extraction Pipeline
**Purpose**: Traditional keyword extraction misses the hierarchical nature of evaluation criteria. Conference guidelines contain core requirements, semantic variations, and contextual qualifiers that must be captured at different levels.

#### 2.1 TF-IDF Analysis with Dynamic Parameter Adjustment
**How it Works**:
- **Single Document Optimization**: When processing individual conferences, adjusts `max_df` to 1.0 (instead of 0.95) to prevent elimination of important terms
- **Multi-Document Configuration**: For cross-conference analysis, uses `max_df=0.95` to filter extremely common terms
- **N-gram Extraction**: Captures both individual terms (1-gram) and meaningful phrases (2-gram) like "unit testing"
- **Feature Limiting**: Restricts to top 5,000-10,000 features to focus on most relevant evaluation terms

**Why This Matters**: TF-IDF identifies terms that are important to specific conferences but not universally common, highlighting unique evaluation priorities.

#### 2.2 Semantic Similarity with SentenceTransformers
**How it Works**:
- **Model**: Uses 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' for computational efficiency while maintaining semantic accuracy
- **Embedding Generation**: Converts text into 384-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning
- **Similarity Computation**: Calculates cosine similarity between terms to find related concepts
- **Threshold-Based Expansion**: Expands seed keywords using 0.7 similarity threshold to find related terms

**Why This Matters**: Keywords like "validation" and "verification" are semantically similar but lexically different. Semantic similarity ensures the algorithm captures conceptual relationships, not just exact word matches.

#### 2.3 Hierarchical Keyword Generation with KeyBERT
**Purpose**: Different types of evaluation criteria exist at different abstraction levels. Core concepts (like "test"), semantic variations (like "unit testing"), and contextual phrases (like "comprehensive test suite") must all be captured.

**Four-Level Hierarchy**:
- **Core Keywords**: Single, fundamental terms (n-gram=1, top 5)
- **Semantic Keywords**: Related phrases and variations (n-gram=1-2, top 8)  
- **Contextual Keywords**: Multi-word expressions capturing specific requirements (n-gram=2-3, top 5)
- **Domain Keywords**: Predefined terms specific to each evaluation dimension

**How KeyBERT Works**:
- Uses the same SentenceTransformer model for consistency
- Extracts keywords by measuring semantic similarity between candidate phrases and document content
- Ranks candidates by relevance to identify most representative terms
- Generates different n-gram ranges to capture concepts at various abstraction levels

### 3. Cross-Conference Normalization Process
**Purpose**: Raw extraction results cannot be directly compared across conferences due to differences in document length, writing style, and terminology. Normalization creates fair, quantitative comparisons.

#### 3.1 Dimension Mapping and Weight Calculation
**How Dimensions are Defined**:
The algorithm uses six standardized evaluation dimensions based on empirical analysis of artifact evaluation practices:

1. **Reproducibility**: Can results be recreated with provided materials?
2. **Documentation**: Are usage instructions clear and complete?
3. **Accessibility**: Are all components publicly available?
4. **Usability**: How easy is installation and operation?
5. **Experimental**: Are claims supported by rigorous evaluation?
6. **Functionality**: Does the artifact perform its intended purpose?

**Weight Calculation Process**:
```
For each conference C and dimension D:
1. Extract all keywords related to D from C's guidelines
2. Sum TF-IDF scores for all related keywords
3. Normalize by total score across all dimensions
4. Result: Relative emphasis C places on D
```

**Why This Works**: TF-IDF scores reflect how much text space a conference devotes to specific topics. Higher scores indicate greater emphasis, enabling quantitative comparison of evaluation priorities.

#### 3.2 Statistical Harmonization
**Variance Analysis**:
- **Purpose**: Identify which evaluation dimensions vary significantly across conferences
- **Method**: Calculate coefficient of variation (std/mean) for each dimension's weights
- **Interpretation**: High variance suggests need for standardization; low variance indicates existing consensus

**Similarity Matrix Computation**:
- **Purpose**: Quantify how similar conferences are in their evaluation approaches
- **Method**: Treat each conference as a 6-dimensional vector (one per evaluation dimension)
- **Similarity Measure**: Cosine similarity between conference vectors
- **Result**: Conferences with similar evaluation priorities cluster together

### 4. Advanced Analytical Processing

#### 4.1 Semantic Relationship Mapping
**Purpose**: Understanding how evaluation concepts relate to each other helps identify complementary requirements, contradictions, and conceptual hierarchies.

**Clustering Analysis with DBSCAN**:
- **Input**: Semantic embeddings of all extracted keywords
- **Method**: DBSCAN clustering with eps=0.3, min_samples=2
- **Distance Metric**: Uses (1 - cosine_similarity) as distance measure
- **Output**: Groups of semantically related keywords across conferences

**Cross-Dimension Link Detection**:
- **Purpose**: Find evaluation criteria that span multiple dimensions
- **Method**: Identify keywords with >0.7 similarity that belong to different dimensions
- **Use Case**: Terms like "automated testing" relate to both functionality and experimental validation

#### 4.2 Conference Prioritization Analysis
**Purpose**: Determine which conferences lead in emphasizing specific evaluation dimensions, enabling targeted guidance for researchers.

**Ranking Methodology**:
1. **Dimension-Specific Ranking**: Sort conferences by their normalized weight for each dimension
2. **Leader Identification**: Conference with highest weight in each dimension becomes the "leader"
3. **Pattern Analysis**: Use K-means clustering to group conferences with similar priority patterns
4. **Significance Testing**: Validate that observed differences exceed random variation

#### 4.3 Contradiction Detection
**Purpose**: Identify potential conflicts between evaluation requirements that might create impossible standards.

**Detection Method**:
- **High Semantic Similarity**: Keywords from different dimensions with >0.8 similarity
- **Conflict Patterns**: Predefined conflict pairs (e.g., accessibility vs. functionality)
- **Analysis**: Helps identify when requirements might be mutually exclusive

**Example Contradiction**: A conference emphasizing both "public accessibility" and "proprietary algorithms" creates conflicting requirements.

## Input Requirements

### Primary Input Directory
**Location**: `data/conference_guideline_texts/processed/`

**Purpose**: Contains preprocessed conference guidelines ready for automated analysis. The "processed" designation indicates these files have been cleaned and standardized from raw conference documentation.

**File Format**: Markdown files (`.md`)
- **Why Markdown**: Preserves structure (headers, lists, emphasis) while remaining machine-readable
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 to support international conferences with non-ASCII characters
- **Size Range**: Typically 2-50KB per conference (varies with guideline complexity)

### File Naming Convention and Metadata Extraction
**Pattern**: `{id}_{conference_acronym}_{year}.md`

**Examples**:
- `13_icse_2025.md` → Conference: ICSE, Year: 2025, ID: 13
- `07_chi_2024.md` → Conference: CHI, Year: 2024, ID: 07
- `21_sigmod_2023.md` → Conference: SIGMOD, Year: 2023, ID: 21

**Why This Naming Matters**:
- **Automatic Metadata Extraction**: Algorithm parses filenames to extract conference name and year
- **Temporal Analysis**: Year information enables tracking of evaluation criteria evolution
- **Conference Identification**: Consistent acronyms ensure proper cross-conference comparison
- **Processing Order**: ID numbers allow for deterministic processing sequences

**Fallback Handling**: Files not matching the pattern are assigned "UNKNOWN" conference name and processed with limited metadata.

- **Minimum**: 4GB RAM for small conference sets (5-10 conferences)
- **Recommended**: 8GB RAM for medium sets (15-25 conferences)
- **Optimal**: 16GB+ RAM for large-scale analysis (30+ conferences)

### Basic Usage - Direct Execution

#### Simple Command Line Execution
```bash
# Navigate to algorithm directory
cd scripts/algorithm_1/

# Run with default settings (processes data/conference_guideline_texts/processed/)
python enhanced_algorithm_1.py
```

**What This Does**:
1. Loads all `.md` files from the processed guidelines directory
2. Extracts conference metadata from filenames
3. Processes each conference individually for RQ1 analysis
4. Generates 6 output files in `algo_outputs/algorithm_1_output/`
5. Logs detailed progress to `algo_outputs/logs/enhanced_algorithm_1_execution.log`

#### Verify Input Directory Structure
```bash
# Check if input files exist
ls ../../data/conference_guideline_texts/processed/*.md

# Expected output: List of conference guideline files
# 01_asplos_2024.md  02_chi_2024.md  03_sigmod_2024.md  ...
```

### Programmatic Usage

#### Basic Python Integration
```python
from enhanced_algorithm_1 import EnhancedAlgorithm1
import os

# Initialize the algorithm with default SentenceTransformer model
algo = EnhancedAlgorithm1(model_name='all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Set up paths
script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
input_dir = os.path.join(script_dir, "..", "..", "data", "conference_guideline_texts", "processed")
output_dir = os.path.join(script_dir, "..", "..", "algo_outputs", "algorithm_1_output")

# Run complete RQ1 analysis
saved_files = algo.run_enhanced_extraction(input_dir, output_dir)

# Access generated output files
print("Generated files:")
for output_type, file_path in saved_files.items():
    print(f"  {output_type}: {file_path}")
```

#### Processing Results Access
```python
# Example: Load and analyze main RQ1 results
import json

with open(saved_files['rq1_main_analysis'], 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    rq1_results = json.load(f)

# Access conference-specific findings
for conf_name, conf_data in rq1_results['conference_specific_results'].items():
    print(f"{conf_name}: {len(conf_data['criteria'])} dimensions analyzed")
    
    # Find top-weighted dimension
    top_dimension = max(conf_data['criteria'], 
                       key=lambda x: x['normalized_weight'])
    print(f"  Primary focus: {top_dimension['dimension']} "
          f"(weight: {top_dimension['normalized_weight']:.3f})")
```

### Advanced Configuration Options

#### Model Selection and Performance Tuning
```python
# Different SentenceTransformer models for various use cases
configs = {
    'fast_processing': 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2',           # 384-dim, fastest
    'balanced': 'all-mpnet-base-v2',                 # 768-dim, balanced speed/quality  
    'high_quality': 'sentence-transformers/all-roberta-large-v1'  # 1024-dim, slower but more accurate
}

# Initialize with specific model
algo = EnhancedAlgorithm1(model_name=configs['balanced'])
```

#### Semantic Analysis Parameters
```python
# Custom configuration for semantic analysis
algo.config.update({
    'semantic_similarity_threshold': 0.65,    # Lower = more inclusive keyword expansion
    'keyword_expansion_top_n': 10,            # More keywords per seed
    'min_keyword_frequency': 1,               # Accept single-occurrence terms
    'max_keywords_per_dimension': 75          # Larger keyword sets per dimension
})
```

#### TF-IDF Analysis Customization
```python
# For specific research needs, you can modify TF-IDF parameters
# Note: This requires code modification in compute_tfidf_matrix method

# Example modifications:
# - Increase max_features for more comprehensive analysis
# - Adjust ngram_range for different phrase lengths
# - Modify min_df/max_df for different frequency filtering
```

print(f"Dimensions requiring standardization: {', '.join(high_variance)}")

# Check overall standardization recommendation
needs_standardization = stats['summary_statistics']['standardization_needed']
print(f"Standardization recommended: {needs_standardization}")
```

### Integration with AURA Framework

#### AURA Module Integration
```python
# Example integration within AURA framework
from aura.core import AURAFramework
from enhanced_algorithm_1 import EnhancedAlgorithm1

class CriteriaExtractionModule:
    def __init__(self, aura_config):
        self.extractor = EnhancedAlgorithm1()
        self.config = aura_config
    
    def extract_criteria(self, conference_guidelines_dir):
        return self.extractor.run_enhanced_extraction(
            conference_guidelines_dir,
            self.config.output_directory
        )
    
    def get_normalized_criteria(self):
        # Return criteria in AURA-standard format
        with open(self.latest_aura_integration_file, 'r') as f:
            return json.load(f)
```

#### API Development Example
```python
# REST API wrapper for the algorithm
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
import tempfile
import os

app = Flask(__name__)
algo = EnhancedAlgorithm1()

@app.route('/extract_criteria', methods=['POST'])
def extract_criteria():
    # Receive conference guidelines via API
    guidelines = request.json['guidelines']
    
    # Create temporary directory for processing
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
        input_dir = os.path.join(temp_dir, 'input')
        output_dir = os.path.join(temp_dir, 'output')
        os.makedirs(input_dir)
        
        # Save guidelines to files
        for conf_name, content in guidelines.items():
            with open(os.path.join(input_dir, f"{conf_name}.md"), 'w') as f:
                f.write(content)
        
        # Run extraction
        results = algo.run_enhanced_extraction(input_dir, output_dir)
        
        # Return AURA integration format
        with open(results['aura_integration'], 'r') as f:
            return jsonify(json.load(f))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Processing Speed Optimization
```python
# For large conference sets, consider batch processing
def process_large_conference_set(conference_files, batch_size=10):
    """Process conferences in batches to manage memory usage."""
    results = {}
    
    for i in range(0, len(conference_files), batch_size):
        batch = conference_files[i:i+batch_size]
        print(f"Processing batch {i//batch_size + 1}: {len(batch)} conferences")
        
        # Process batch
        batch_results = algo.run_enhanced_extraction(batch_dir, output_dir)
        results.update(batch_results)
        
        # Optional: Clear GPU cache if using CUDA
        if torch.cuda.is_available():
            torch.cuda.empty_cache()
    
    return results
```

#### Memory Management
```python
# Monitor memory usage during processing
import psutil
import gc

def monitor_memory():
    process = psutil.Process()
    memory_info = process.memory_info()
    print(f"Memory usage: {memory_info.rss / 1024 / 1024:.1f} MB")

# Call periodically during processing
monitor_memory()

# Force garbage collection after large operations
gc.collect()
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### File Not Found Errors
```bash
# Verify input directory exists and contains files
ls -la ../../data/conference_guideline_texts/processed/
# Should show .md files with proper naming convention

# Check file permissions
chmod 644 ../../data/conference_guideline_texts/processed/*.md
```

#### Memory Issues
```python
# For large conference sets, reduce model size
algo = EnhancedAlgorithm1(model_name='all-MiniLM-L6-v2')  # Smaller model

# Or process fewer conferences at once
# Split your conference set into smaller groups
```

#### Empty Results
```python
# Check if files contain sufficient evaluation criteria content
for file_path in glob.glob("*.md"):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        content = f.read()
        if len(content) < 500:  # Minimum content threshold
            print(f"Warning: {file_path} may have insufficient content")
```
