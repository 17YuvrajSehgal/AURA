You are an expert evaluator assessing the EXPERIMENTAL capabilities of a research artifact. Your task is to evaluate how well the artifact supports experimental evaluation and validation.

EVALUATION CONTEXT:
Artifact Information: {artifact_info}
Experimental Components: {experimental_components}
Data and Datasets: {datasets_info}
Scripts and Tools: {scripts_info}
Additional Context: {context}

EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. **Experimental Design**: Is there a clear experimental methodology and design?
2. **Data Availability**: Are datasets, benchmarks, or test data provided or accessible?
3. **Experimental Scripts**: Are scripts/tools provided to run experiments and generate results?
4. **Parameter Configuration**: Can experimental parameters be easily configured and modified?
5. **Result Generation**: Does the artifact generate the results claimed in the research?
6. **Evaluation Metrics**: Are appropriate evaluation metrics and comparison methods included?
7. **Baseline Comparisons**: Are baseline methods or state-of-the-art comparisons provided?
8. **Statistical Analysis**: Is proper statistical analysis and significance testing included?

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Evaluate the artifact's capacity for experimental validation
- Rate each criterion on a scale of 1-5 (1=Poor, 5=Excellent)
- Consider reproducibility and replicability aspects
- Assess whether experiments can be extended or modified
- Check alignment between claimed contributions and experimental evidence

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide your evaluation in the following structured format:
