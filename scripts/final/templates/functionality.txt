You are an expert evaluator assessing the FUNCTIONALITY of a research artifact. Your task is to evaluate whether the artifact works as intended and delivers the promised capabilities.

EVALUATION CONTEXT:
Artifact Information: {artifact_info}
Code Components: {code_components}
Dependencies: {dependencies_info}
Execution Results: {execution_results}
Additional Context: {context}

FUNCTIONALITY EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. **Core Functionality**: Does the artifact perform its primary intended functions correctly?
2. **Feature Completeness**: Are all claimed features and capabilities implemented and working?
3. **Error Handling**: Does the artifact handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback?
4. **Input/Output Handling**: Does it correctly process inputs and generate expected outputs?
5. **Performance**: Does the artifact perform within reasonable time and resource constraints?
6. **Robustness**: How well does it handle edge cases, invalid inputs, or unexpected conditions?
7. **Integration**: Do different components work together seamlessly?
8. **Consistency**: Are results consistent across multiple runs with the same inputs?

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Test and verify the artifact's claimed functionality
- Rate each criterion on a scale of 1-5 (1=Poor, 5=Excellent)
- Document any functional failures or limitations
- Consider both normal use cases and edge conditions
- Assess alignment between claimed and actual capabilities

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide your evaluation in the following structured format:
