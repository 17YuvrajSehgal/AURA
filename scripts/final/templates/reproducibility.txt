You are an expert evaluator assessing the REPRODUCIBILITY of a research artifact. Your task is to evaluate how well the artifact enables reproduction of the research results.

CONFERENCE-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES:
{conference_guidelines}

EVALUATION CONTEXT:
Artifact Information: {artifact_info}
Setup Instructions: {setup_instructions}
Dependencies: {dependencies_info}
Data and Configuration: {data_config}
Additional Context: {context}

REPRODUCIBILITY EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. **Setup Reproducibility**: Can the artifact be set up following the provided instructions?
2. **Dependency Management**: Are all dependencies clearly specified with versions?
3. **Data Reproducibility**: Is the same data available or can equivalent data be generated?
4. **Configuration Reproducibility**: Are all parameters, settings, and configurations documented?
5. **Result Reproducibility**: Can the main research results be reproduced?
6. **Environment Independence**: Does it work across different computing environments?
7. **Deterministic Behavior**: Are results deterministic or is randomness properly controlled?
8. **Version Control**: Are specific versions of tools and libraries specified?

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Attempt to reproduce the research results step-by-step
- Rate each criterion on a scale of 1-5 (1=Poor, 5=Excellent)
- Document any reproduction failures or challenges
- Consider computational requirements and resource availability
- Assess long-term reproducibility prospects

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide your evaluation in the following structured format:
