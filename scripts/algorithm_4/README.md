# 🧠 Automated Multi-Agent README Generator

This repository contains a sophisticated, automated system designed to generate high-quality, academic-style `README.md` files for software or research artifacts. It leverages a **multi-agent workflow** powered by **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **OpenAI's GPT-4**, and includes detailed logging, prompt chaining, section scoring, and iterative refinement.

---

## 📌 Purpose

Creating a comprehensive and standardized `README.md` for research codebases can be tedious and inconsistent. This system automates the documentation pipeline by:

- **Parsing repository structure**
- **Extracting code and license information**
- **Generating README sections with GPT-4 agents**
- **Reviewing and refining output for academic clarity and completeness**
- **Producing a final quality-assessed README document**

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. **Setup and Environment**
- Environment variables are loaded using `dotenv`.
- Logging is configured to output both to file and console.
- UTF-8 encoding ensures compatibility with multilingual content.

### 2. **Initial LLM Setup**
- The system uses `ChatOpenAI` with GPT-4 and a low temperature (0.2) for deterministic behavior.

### 3. **README State Definition**
A global state object (`READMEState`) stores:
- Parsed context and structure
- Code/License metadata
- Required README sections
- Generated content
- Quality score (0–1)

## 🧠 Multi-Agent Workflow

This project uses a **multi-agent architecture** where each agent has a specialized role in the README generation lifecycle:

| Agent | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| **Planner Agent** | Identifies necessary README sections based on the repository context |
| **Author Agent** | Drafts section content tailored to best practices |
| **Editor Agent** | Improves readability, formatting, and structure |
| **Critic Agent** | Scores the content and provides actionable feedback |
| **Evaluator Agent** | Evaluates the full README quality (0–1) |
| *(Optional)* Optimizer | Refines low-score sections to improve clarity |

---

## 🗂️ Supported Sections

The system generates the following common sections (and more if contextually required):

- Overview / Project Structure
- Installation
- Usage
- Requirements
- Examples
- License
- Troubleshooting / FAQ
- Contributing
- Reproducibility
- References / Related Work

Each section is generated based on rich, section-specific prompts with injected metadata (repository structure, code samples, license text, etc.).
